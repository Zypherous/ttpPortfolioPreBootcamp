# Portfolio for TTP Cohort 6 Assessment - Jonathan Rosario

A portfolio website. Designed over two days, it was quite a challenge but a great learning experience. Hope you get as much enjoyment looking through it as I did creating it!

Assignment was to create a portfolio website without any prior knowledge of webdevelopment.
